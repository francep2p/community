# Paris P2P 101

Paris peer2peer is you, us, anybody that wants to get involved in creating a thriving community around P2P technologies and cryptography.

It aims to be a signalling server for all of us to meet new peers, extend our network and exchange about P2P/cryptography.

We will provide a recurring monthly meetup (each first Wednesday of the month) to gather, show and discuss P2P and cryptography, as well as more themed specific event with the presentation or workshops.

# Values

We are a peer 2 peer organisation, and as such, rather that edict a set of rules, we prefer to see what values define us.

- Open and free: our monthly events are social events, they are open to everybody and won't be only technical. Curious minds are more than welcome, registration in meetup.com is not mandatory, and is used mostly for the initial reach and to get a rough idea of the event size.
Open to all, but you won't feel welcome here if you:
    - discriminate any group for any reason
    - detain the one truth / can't see your views challenged
    - have issue understanding the concept of boundaries / consent
    - [are a dick](https://github.com/aeddi/dontbeadick)
- Peer2Peer: we want you to meet as many peers as possible, and provide a space where new ideas/groups/projects can be created.
- Autonomous: currently most of us are Paris-based, so this group is ParisP2P, midterm plans include an umbrella organisation (a bit like "FranceJS") for France's P2P events, we can help organising your own P2P events by sharing contacts, content, tools, and whatever we can to help  create a mesh of autonomous node, and organise meta event to exchanges with all communities. [Contact us](mailto:bootstrap@p2p.paris) if you plan to start something, and follow or participate in this [GitHub thread](https://github.com/parisp2p/community/issues/5) to contribute in this adventure
- Non-profit: money/commercial projects are NOT forbidden subjects, but this group does not aim to be an echo chamber for the next fool's gold experiment/coins; though we can still have constructive discussions about these.

# Roadmap

- building the first node of the community in Paris
- provide a framework / tools for other nodes to emerge
- create a supernode ("p2pFr" ???)
- enjoy meeting people from the mesh network of p2p communities all around the world
- organise meta event between our nodes
