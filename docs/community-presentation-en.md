# Paris P2P

We organize physical meetings to discuss around P2P, decentralization, autonomous networks and communities, distributed systems, decentralized systems, offline-first apps, mesh networks, privacy, anti-surveillance, anti-censorship, security, cryptography, blockchains.

## A real-life Person 2 Person meet up!

P2P Paris is above all an opportunity to exchange in Paris (FR).
Sometimes P2P is translated as "person to person".
We were wondering why we wouldn't do that in real life: let's talk person to person face to face!

Although these are developer-oriented meetings, there is no level required! The subjects discussed can be philosophical, ethical, conceptual.
No particular skill is required unless an openminded brain!

## About us:

Just a bunch of enthusiasts who wish to talk, exchange last news and share ideas around P2P technologies in Paris.
If you want to know who we are, the easiest way is to come and see us!
